Created Car class, CarTest and CarSetting enum.
Car class is missing two values timeStep and nextFrontPosition.
I'm not sure if these values should be stored in this class.

CarTest does not have any tests in it.  
 I also reviewed the final project documentation. 

Created class packages and included the timeserver in the simulation.agent package.
